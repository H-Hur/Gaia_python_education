1. modify "astroquery_example_mod.py" to download data
 - insert R.A. and Dec.: ra1:ra2:ra3 & dec1:dedc2:dec3
 - insert output file name(csv file)
 - insert fov 
2. run "astroquery_example_mod.py": the output file will be generated.
3. modify "opencluster_mem.py" to check X,Y ranges of diagrams and number of
groups
 - replace input_csv as the output file name(csv file) set in #1
 - insert output_group file name
 - you may change the GMM part
4. run "opencluster_mem.py" 
 - modify the X and Y axis ranges and run again, until all diagrams seems good
5. modify "opencluster_mem.py" to adjust the GMM clusering
 - modify n_components as seen in pmra(X) - pmdec(Y) diagram.
 - if the GMM model cannot fit the source distribution in the diagram, change
   n_components and run again until the model select cluster sources well.
